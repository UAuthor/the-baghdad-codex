<p>Welcome to The Golden Library.</p>


<p>[Verily], all praise is for Allaah, [we praise Him and] we seek His assistance and we ask for His forgiveness.<br>
    And we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils of our selves [and from the evils of our actions].<br>
<br>
Whoever Allaah guides, there is no one that can lead him astray, and whoever is led astray, there is no guide for him.<br>
<br>
I bear witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah – [alone and with no partner] – <br>
and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.<br>
