    <p>Welcome to The Golden Library.</p>

    <p>
        In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful<br><br>

        [Verily], all praise is for Allaah, [we praise Him and] we seek His assistance and we ask for His forgiveness.<br>
        And we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils of our selves [and from the evils of our actions].<br><br>

        Whoever Allaah guides, there is no one that can lead him astray, and whoever is led astray, there is no guide for him.<br><br>

        I bear witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah – [alone and with no partner] – <br>
        and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger.<br><br><br>

    <div class="arabic">
    بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم<br><br>

    تقديم<br><br>

    إن الحمد لله، نحمده ونستعينه ونستغفره، ونعوذُ بالله من شرور أنفسنا ومن سيئات أعمالنا،<br>
    من يهده الله فلا مُضِلَّ له، ومَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَا هَادِيَ له،<br><br>

    وأشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له، وأَشْهَد أَنَّ محمَّدًا عبده ورسوله،
    صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وأصحابه ومن تبعهم بإحسان إلى يوم الدين، وسلَّم تسليما كثيرا.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    This website, The Golden Library, has been created as a humble effort to gather and present biographies that are often difficult to access or scattered across the books of the scholars. <br>
    Its purpose is to serve as a clear and organized library — a codex — of the lives of the people of importance mentioned in the Qur’an and the Sunnah, as well as the companions, the scholars, <br>
    and other figures of significance in Islamic history.<br>
<br>
    The intention behind this work is to make knowledge more accessible and to assist Muslims in learning about the righteous predecessors, their lives, their struggles, and their contributions, <br>
    without difficulty or confusion. The biographies presented here are extracted and compiled from the works of the scholars, and the sources will be provided in every entry.<br>
<br>
    This project is a personal effort and has not been authenticated or reviewed by any scholar. It is undertaken while seeking knowledge and striving for clarity and correctness, <br>
    in the hope that it may benefit the Ummah and encourage learning about the companions and other important figures of Islam.<br>
